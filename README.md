Bio

I updated my bio page about myself. The page had to include working links that are contact, about, and portfolio. Bootstrap was used to help with layout and other factors. This page also had to be responsive in any size window. Created a side bar that is fixed.

Technologies used: Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, font awesome
